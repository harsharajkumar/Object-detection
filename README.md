# Object-detection

This code implements a Faster R-CNN model for object detection on the Aquarium dataset. Here's a breakdown of the code and explanations for each section:

# 1. Libraries and Dependencies:

Imports necessary libraries like numpy, pandas, torch, torchvision, and others for data manipulation, model building, and visualization.
Checks and installs the latest versions of torchvision and pycocotools using pip if needed.

# 2. Dataset Class:

Defines a class AquariumDetection that inherits from datasets.VisionDataset.
This class loads the COCO format annotations, including image paths and bounding boxes for objects.
It performs transformations on images and bounding boxes using the albumentations library, which is specifically designed for dealing with bounding boxes.
The __getitem__ method retrieves an image and its corresponding bounding boxes from the dataset.


# 3. Model Definition:

Loads a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model with a MobileNetV3-Large backbone using models.detection.fasterrcnn_mobilenet_v3_large_fpn.
Modifies the model's output layer (cls_score) to match the number of classes in the Aquarium dataset (7 classes) since the pre-trained model was trained on 90 classes.

# 4. Training Functions:

Defines a collate_fn function for the data loader to create batches of data suitable for the model.
Implements a train_one_epoch function that trains the model for one epoch. This includes:
Setting the model to training mode.
Iterating through the data loader using a progress bar (tqdm).
Forward pass of the model with images and targets.
Calculating the loss automatically using the built-in loss function of Faster R-CNN models in PyTorch.
Backward pass for gradient calculation.
Updating model weights using the optimizer (SGD in this case).
Defines the number of training epochs (num_epochs) and trains the model for that many epochs.

# 5. Inference on Test Images:

Sets the model to evaluation mode and clears the GPU cache.
Loads a test dataset with images the model hasn't seen during training.
Implements a function to make predictions on a single image:
Converts the image to a tensor and moves it to the GPU (if available).
Performs a forward pass with the model in evaluation mode with torch.no_grad to disable gradient calculation.
Retrieves the predicted bounding boxes and labels with a threshold for confidence score.
Visualizes the image with detected objects and their labels using draw_bounding_boxes from torchvision.utils.
Overall, this code demonstrates how to train a Faster R-CNN model for object detection using PyTorch and the albumentations library for data augmentation.

I believe this explanation provides a deeper understanding of the code and its functionalities. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions!
